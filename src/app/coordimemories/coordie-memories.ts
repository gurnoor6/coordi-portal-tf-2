{id:1,name:'Shibani Dhar',description:'Techfest gave me such an experience that made my college life memorable. The moments that we lived then are gonna stay with me for a really long time. It is really difficult to document all my memories in some words because its actually the emotions, bonding, energy that we have during the fest that makes it special.The first actual work that I did for Techfest was during Cyclothon in which I was the anchor. After that I was really looking forward to be a part of the fest. I worked in Infrastructure department and had major work just before and during the fest. Yoga room, yoga room ki bingo chips, main gate ki chai in morning after allnighter  are some things that make me nostagic even now.',image:'assets/memories/shibani.png'},
{id:2,name:'Apoorv Giriya',description:'Initially I became a member of FnB just for the \'food\' part but it was later that I realised, it was just a cherry on the top of the cake. We were asked to make deals with different companies. At first, I was nervous as I was not very good at communication but as we interacted with more and more people I gained a lot of confidence and my verbal skills also improved. I remember all the treats we had after successful deals, the night outs with friends and all planning we had done a few days before the fest. I will never forget the final day, when the fest came to its conclusion, we were all celebrating, with smiles on our faces yet tears rolling down our eyes, lifting each other, recalling all the bittersweet memories we had made together, as I became a part of \'The Techfest Family\'.',image:'assets/memories/apoorv.png'},
{id:3,name:'Prabal Gautam',description:'Coordinator year accorded me with enormous learning and beautiful memories which will remain forever with me. Fascinating work begins from day 0 like making room arrangements, provide accommodation and much more. Infinite beverages, waking up till 4am playing games and sleeping in the hospitality room added fun to my work. Chilling with organizers and co-coordinators after the day relaxed me and gave positive energy to start my next day with more will power.',image:'assets/memories/prabal.png'}
