Co-coordies turned to cool buddies; The TF Coordie experience is so much to share besides handling impromptu events and cracking deals. One week\'s experience in the sets got no words, The empowered feeling when the organizers follow you and the love you get from them when the fest ends are equally amazing. And yeah; not to mention the best part...,infinite freebies ; P"',

I got exposure to a variety of tasks. From planning the detailed run-throughs to making sure that they were executed impeccably, it was quite hectic but thoroughly enjoyable too!Got to thank all the people who were there with me during that time, from Naman and my co-cordies to the amazing team of organisers I could work with."',

The best feeling that I experienced was the satisfaction at the end of each of the three days of Techfest when we saw how beautifully all our efforts which we put into making that one thing, paid off and we realised that yes! This was worth it!! The unforgettable memories and making life long friends was what that Techfest meant to me!!',

Fascinating work begins from day 0 like making room arrangements, provide accommodation and much more. Infinite beverages, waking up till 4am playing games and sleeping in the hospitality room added fun to my work. Chilling with organizers and co-coordinators after the day relaxed me and gave positive energy to start my next day with more will power.',image:'assets/memories/prabal gautam-min.png'},

It is really difficult to document all my memories in some words because it\'s actually the emotions, bonding, energy that we have during the fest that makes it special. I worked in Infrastructure department and had major work just before and during the fest. Yoga room, yoga room ki bingo chips, main gate ki chai in morning after allnighter  are some things that make me nostagic even now. Techfest gave me an oppurtunity to interact with so many people and make so many new friends. I still remember the feeling when we stood on the stage after the Technoholix event and everyone was happy, nostalgic, senti, excited at the same time. I still remember that feeling as I\'m writing this!"',

We were asked to make deals with different companies. At first, I was nervous as I was not very good at communication but as we interacted with more and more people I gained a lot of confidence and my verbal skills also improved. I remember all the treats we had after successful deals, the night outs with friends and all planning we had done a few days before the fest. I will never forget the final day, when the fest came to its conclusion, we were all celebrating, with smiles on our faces yet tears rolling down our eyes, lifting each other, recalling all the bittersweet memories we had made together, as I became a part of \'The Techfest Family\'.',image:'assets/memories/apoorv-min.png'},

We had a bonfire each night and even though we were exhausted beyond what was physically possible, no one slept! The head banging on the concert night and the high that it gives you is irreplaceable. Keeping to it’s tagline “#DreamOn!”, it truely is an otherworldy dreamy affair <3 It’s more of a journey than just a 3 day extravaganza, from the dreadful days of databasing to the time when you see the first pillar stand tall in the back longue, you have grown as a person.I had my coordie year as a part of the Ozone family, and was given the responsibility of wall painting/graffiti of the mainwall"',

Those SAC night-outs for debugging the app, exploiting the co-ordie batch to it’s fullest, the euphoria of being on the stage on the last day & the senti because it ended (the view of the dense excited crowd is still so fresh) , the imperishable bonds,  the photoshoots and the TAJ treat - TF has etched a special placed in my heart. To add to the adventure, we bonded with random groups and I feel that’s the beauty of this fest. The adrenaline kick of being a part of the BTS group of the mammoth fest that the outside-world sees is something I wouldn’t trade off for anything else, ever.',

All those sleepless nights, the fest madness and finally the feeling of accomplishment when every team member rushes the main stage and it finally ends, all of this will have a special place in my heart. And the most important thing of all is TechFest taught me is #DreamOn',

I started working in the summers itself, contacting the top executives for association and handling the sponsor deliverables during fest was my task. Undoubtedly, those sleepless nights will be worth cherishing when you get to be on that big stage on the final night! Sometimes I envy why did it end this soon. I would urge anyone who has the opportunity to be a part of Asia\'s largest  Sci-Tech fest! Don\'t miss it for the world!',
